#### A simple program to discretize surfaces from simple CAD models.

This is a full interface program that aims to discretize any kind of surface from a CAD model in IGES (Initial Graphics Exchange
Specification) format. The main goal is to provide useful tools to create measurements errors and manufacturing errors, which will be used to analyse how these erros affects the model or the assembly in general.

It is currently under development, with this repo being used as a test repo, and not an official one.
