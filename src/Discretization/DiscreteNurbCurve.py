    We need to implement a method to calculate points that lies in
    a Nurb curve, given the Nurb curve parameters.
    It will be useful to generate aproximation models of curves, so they can
    be used together with the Even-Odd Rule to determinee the insideness of
    a given point in space, or even to calculate the Discrete Winding Number.
